#----------------------------

# Set this to 'macro' to use DF 0.31.x's macro ability (very fast).
# Set this to 'key' to send keystrokes to the DF game window (slower).
# The visualize command (Alt+V) always sends keystrokes.

# Try increasing this value if you have trouble with a flickering

# issue).

# Key-sending
#----------------------------

# Determines key-sending method, one of: ControlSend Send SendEvent
# SendInput SendPlay The default of ControlSend permits QF to send
# keystrokes to DF even when the window is not focused, but could be
# unreliable in certain environments.
# Details: http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/commands/Send.htm
SendMode = Send

# Controls how long QF waits between sending keystrokes.
# Increase this value if things go too quickly for your computer
# when digging/building; decrease to build faster. Slower computers,
# larger resolutions and bigger DF maps may need a larger delay.

# How long to pause after building doors, picking from materials
# lists, etc. If QF seems to go off the rails in these
# circumstances, try increasing this value.
