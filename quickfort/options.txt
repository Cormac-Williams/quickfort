# single constructions up to 10 cells wide using DF resizing keys.
# Works for building: Cw Cf CF Cr o
# This setting can sometimes cause problems if you don't have a big
# stockpile of a single rock/material type nearby.
# Set to 0 if you don't want to worry about this.

# Use diagonal movement keys optimization?

# 10 units). DF seems to work better when this optimization is
# disabled.
DisableShiftOptimizations = 1

# Note: the below option is irrelevant if DisableShiftOptimizations=1.
# Set to 1 to disable converting cursor movements such as
# {Left}x9 into {Shift+Right}{Left}. While this can be a much faster
# method of cursor movement, it can cause problems if you're
# building very close to the edges of the map, since QF can
# overshoot the edges of your blueprint area and thus cause the DF
# cursor to get off-position if close to an edge.
