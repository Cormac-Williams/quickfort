The QuickfortAHK folder contains the AutoHotKey portion of the
Quickfort tool. Currently this is a standalone, fully functional
Quickfort implementation.

The QuickfortPy folder contains a new Python based implementation of
Quickfort's core building algorithm. In QuickfortPy, the building
algorithm is optimized to minimize the number of keystrokes used to
build a blueprint.

In the near future Quickfort will rely on QuickfortPy for the 'heavy
lifting' build algorithms and QuickfortAHK will continue to provide
the frontend on Windows (and, with the arrival of IronAHK, Linux/Mac).
