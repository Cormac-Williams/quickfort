iterate through all points:
    for each quadrant:
        for each natural number a:
        {
            for each natural number b:
            {
                is position (a, b) something we want to build from?
                {
                    no:
                        next loop
                    yes:
                    {
                        price = dist_to_start_from_here
                                + dist_to_end_from_here
                                + keycost(getbuildstring(from a1,b1 to a2,b2)
                        if price < lowestPrice
                        {
                            lowestPrice := price
                            lowestPricePos := (a, b)
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }

distance to startpoint + #keys to build + distance to endpoint, lowest score wins
don't bother checking locations that would necessarily be higher than our best score so far
